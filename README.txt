
kengdic is a large Korean/English dictionary database created by Joe Speigle. It was originally hosted at ezkorean.com, and I have posted it here (https://github.com/garfieldnate/kengdic) because it is no longer available anywhere else. It is released under [MPL 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).

There's not a lot of information here because I have not yet looked deeply at it. Any contributions to information about this content would be much appreciated.
