kengdic is a large Korean/English dictionary database created by Joe
Speigle. It was originally hosted at ezkorean.com, and was made
available by Garfield Nate <https://github.com/garfieldnate/kengdic>
because it was no longer available anywhere else. This implementation
provides serverless access via a convenient SQLite API. The dictionary is
released under MPL 2.0.

Details
-------

From Garfield Nate <https://github.com/garfieldnate>:

"I found a note from Joe Speigle at http://www.perapera.org/korean/
last year (2013):

    the lowdown is that my dictionary has about 90,000 words in it of
    which 70,000 have been human-verified by me, and has about 20,000
    hanja which are linked to the correct definition though the word is
    the same (and the hanja are different). This is more than either
    English wiktionary (which has K as a definition) or the K-K
    wiktionary. I have never found a more complete dictionary online or
    anywhere for korean-English that is opensource as mine. That is why
    I made it, people. I'm not into reduplicating the wheel as they
    say. I have spent thousands of hours on this project. was it worth
    it? ... Anybody can contact me about this, I am extremely willing
    to share all knowledge I have about it. My email address is at
    the bottom of the page for ezcorean.com

Unfortunately, it was my sad finding that Joe Speigle passed away last
year. The Wayback machine indexed ezkorean.com, but did not index
kengdic, his amazing dictionary. After quite a bit of searching, I
found that Maran Emil Cristian had obtained and stored a copy. He was
kind enough to copy it for me, and so now I am able to provide it here."
